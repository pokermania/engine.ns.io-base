# engine.ns.io

engine.ns.io takes the concept of having different event for different
types of messages (Ã  la socket.io) back to engine.io

It does so by minimally extending the engine.io Socket prototype, adding a
`Socket.send_ns(type,data)` method which will then on the receiving part be
emitted as the chosen event type. 

Sending of 'raw' strings for performance-critical application parts can still
be done by using `Socket.send_raw` and listening on the `'raw'` event.

## Usage

Server:

```coffee
nsio = require 'engine.ns.io'
server = engine.listen 8080

server.on 'connection', (socket) ->
  # send a 'welcome' message, containing greeting and 
  # a list of users
  data =
    greeting: 'hello there!'
    users: ['alice','bob']

  socket.send_ns 'welcome',data
```

Client/Browser: 

*(use `make dist` in `engine.ns.io-client` to build the module for*
*the browser by using `browserbuild`)*

```js
socket = new nsio.Socket({host: 'localhost', port: 8080});

socket.on('welcome',function(data) {
  // contains sent object
  console.log(data);
});
```
